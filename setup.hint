sdesc: "Client-side implementation of the rsync algorithm"
ldesc: "A file transfer program to download files from remote web servers. If
a previous version of a file is available locally, zsync will only
download changed parts and hereby minimise the download volume. The
algorithm is the same as used by rsync(1), but zsync does not require
any server software (apart from a web server), nor does it need shell
access. Instead, it uses a control file (.zsync file) that describes
the file to be downloaded, which it uses to determine the blocks to
fetch. This file is created once on the server (and not for each
request) and sits next to actual file to download."
